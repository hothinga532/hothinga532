# Ho Thi Nga - Portfolio
## About
My name is Ho Thi Nga, I just graduated from HCMUT with a major in business administration. I have acquired skills in SQL, Python, and Excel, which allow me to work with data effectively. Eager to turn complex data into meaningful insights, I am trying to develop proficiency in data cleaning, statistical modeling, and data visualization. Find trends and patterns in the data and make possible recommendations based on my findings.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics topics
